  # Home Manager needs a bit of information about you and the
  # paths it should manage.
  #
  # You need to change these to match your username and home directory
  # path:
  home.username = "$USER";
  home.homeDirectory = "$HOME";

  # If you use non-standard XDG locations, set these options to the
  # appropriate paths:
  #
  # xdg.cacheHome
  # xdg.configHome
  # xdg.dataHome

  # This value determines the Home Manager release that your
  # configuration is compatible with. This helps avoid breakage
  # when a new Home Manager release introduces backwards
  # incompatible changes.
  #
  # You can update Home Manager without changing this value. See
  # the Home Manager release notes for a list of state version
  # changes in each release.
  home.stateVersion = "20.09";

  # Since we do not install home-manager, you need to let home-manager
  # manage your shell, otherwise it will not be able to add its hooks
  # to your profile.
  programs.bash = {
    enable = true;
  };
